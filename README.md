# C++ Course Management System

## Project Description
This C++ program manages the courses a Computer Science student has taken so far in their bachelorâ€™s program. It uses a linked list to store courses, where each course contains a course code, credit hours, and grade. The list allows the following operations:
- Add a course
- Delete a course
- Delete all courses
- Display all courses

2. After the courses are entered, the program displays the list, deletes two courses, and then displays the updated list.

## Output Result
The program will print the list of courses before and after deleting two selected courses.

## Procedures to Run the Program
1. Compile all the files: class header, class implementation, and main function.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Follow the prompts to input 10 courses.
4. Choose two courses to delete.
5. View the course list before and after deletion.
